I am a second year Ph.D student at [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.iisc.ac.in){:target="_blank"}, [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} working with [Prof. PS Sastry](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/sastry-p-s/){:target="_blank"}.

My interests are in weakly supervised learning and deep learning theory. Currently, I am working on the problem of learning under _label noise_ and _adversarial noise_ with _deep neural nets_. I am also exploring the robustness properties of mammalian vision-inspired feedback mechanisms for deep neural networks.

Previously, I did my M.Tech (Research) with [Prof. PS Sastry](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/sastry-p-s/){:target="_blank"} in the same department and, as a part of my master's thesis, I worked on _robust supervised learning in the presence of label noise_. Before that, I spent a year as a Project Assistant at [SPIRE Lab, IISc](https://spire.ee.iisc.ac.in/spire/){:target="_blank"} where I was advised by [Prof. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/prasanta-kumar-ghosh/){:target="_blank"} on speech-based automated disease onset detection and severity prediction of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's Disease.
