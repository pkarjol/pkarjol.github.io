I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} working with [Prof. Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/){:target="_blank"}.

I am interested in the aspects of Large-Scale Optimization and Probability theory that arise in fundamental Machine Learning. Related topics that have caught my recent attention are Stochastic gradient flow/descent on non-convex landscapes, and learning and optimization under over-parameterization. I also like learning Topology, Analysis and theoretical Physics.

Previously, I spent two wonderful years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://praneethnetrapalli.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/){:target="_blank"} on provable non-convex optimization algorithms for Machine Learning and understanding several phenomena in deep learning. Prior to the fellowship, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017.
