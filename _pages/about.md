I am a third year Ph.D student at [Department of Electrical Communication Engineering](https://ece.iisc.ac.in), [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/) working with [Prof. Prathosh A P](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home). My research is supported by the [Prime Minister's Research Fellowship](https://www.pmrf.in/).

My interests are in equivariant and invariant function approximation, automatic symmetry discovery and deep learning theory.

Previously, I did my M.Tech (Research) with [Prof. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/prasanta-kumar-ghosh/)
